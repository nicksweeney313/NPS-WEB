    "text": "Nicholas P. Sweeney is the Sir Terry Leahy Fellow of Urban and Regional Economics at Alliance Manchester Business School.\nHis research examines the multi-dimensional drivers and effects of spatial inequality, and the role of place-based policy in ameliorating disparities both between and within regions. Underpinning his research is the use of contemporary data availability improvements to refine theoretical and empirical understanding of longstanding debates on economic, political and social matters.\nThe why of Nicholas’ holistic research comes from growing up in Liverpool, a region that has experienced significant economic decline and now evidences some of the lowest incomes, political engagement and health outcomes in England – the most spatially unequal developed country. The belief that evidenced-based, practical, applied research and policy lessons can help to improve livelihoods across the world motivates his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions, decentralisation, and multi-level governance\n\nSpatial inequalities and local economic development\n\nPolitical (dis)engagement in declining places\n\nMobility, access to services, and health inequalities\n\n\n\n\n\nCausal inference in applied microeconometrics (difference-in-differences, matching, instrumental variables)\n\nSpatial analysis and geospatial data (GIS / QGIS workflows)\n\nReproducible research in R and Python\n\n\n\n\nNicholas joined the University of Manchester in 2025 from the University of Cambridge, after submitting his three solo-authored PhD entitled Devolution and Space in England: Empirical Essays on Economic Growth, Democratic Engagement and Health in under three years.
