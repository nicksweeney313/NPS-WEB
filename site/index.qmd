*Nicholas P. Sweeney* is the Sir Terry Leahy Fellow of Urban and Regional Economics at Alliance Manchester Business School. His research examines the political and economic drivers of spatial inequality, with a particular focus on the role of institutions, multi-level governance, and place-based policy in England.

Nicholas joined the University of Manchester in 2025 from the University of Cambridge, after submitting his three solo-authored PhD entitled *Devolution and Space in England: Empirical Essays on Economic Growth, Democratic Engagement and Health* in under three years. All three papers were subsequently published in leading journals (Urban Studies, Political Geography, and Social Science & Medicine, respectively).

Nicholas also completed his Master’s and undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge. He gained a Distinction in his Master’s degree and received the highest overall marks in his undergraduate cohort, as well as the award for best final-year dissertation.
