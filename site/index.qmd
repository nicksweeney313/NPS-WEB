### Bio

::: {.bio-card}

::: {.bio-text}
*Nicholas P. Sweeney* is the Sir Terry Leahy Fellow of Urban and Regional Economics at Alliance Manchester Business School. 

His research examines the multi-dimensional drivers and effects of spatial inequality, and the role of place-based policy in ameliorating disparities both between and within regions.
Underpinning his research is the use of contemporary data availability improvements to refine theoretical and empirical understanding of longstanding debates
on economic, political and social matters.

The *why* of Nicholas' holistic research comes from growing up in Liverpool, 
a region that has experienced significant economic decline and now evidences 
some of the lowest incomes, political engagement and health outcomes in England -- the most spatially unequal developed country. The belief that evidenced-based, 
practical, applied research and policy lessons can help to improve livelihoods across the world motivates his work.

### Educational History

Nicholas joined the University of Manchester in 2025 from the University of Cambridge, 
after submitting his three solo-authored PhD entitled *Devolution and Space in England: 
Empirical Essays on Economic Growth, Democratic Engagement and Health* in under three years.
All three papers were subsequently published in leading journals (Urban Studies, 
Political Geography, and Social Science & Medicine, respectively).
